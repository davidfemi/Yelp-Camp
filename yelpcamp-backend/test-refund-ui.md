# ðŸ§ª Testing Refund UI - Quick Guide

## Current Issue
The order in your screenshot doesn't show refund info because it was likely cancelled before the refund system was implemented.

## How to Test the Refund UI

### 1. Create a New Test Order
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/shop
2. Add any product to cart
3. Complete checkout with test address

### 2. Cancel the Order with Refund
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/orders
2. Find your new order (should be "Pending" status)
3. Click on the order to open details
4. Click "Cancel Order" button
5. Confirm cancellation

### 3. What You Should See

#### Success Message:
```
âœ… Order cancelled and $XX.XX refund processed
```

#### In Order Details Modal After Cancellation:
```
Status: Cancelled ðŸ”´

Status & Activity:
âœ… Order Placed
   [Date and time]

ðŸ”„ Refund Processed
   $XX.XX refunded on [Date]

Payment Details:
Method: simulated
Transaction ID: sim_[timestamp]_[random]
Paid: [Date and time]
```

### 4. Also Test Bookings
1. Go to any campground page
2. Book for X days
3. Go to Orders page, find the booking
4. Cancel it - should see similar refund info

## Troubleshooting

If refund info still doesn't show:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify both frontend and backend are running
3. Make sure you're cancelling a NEW order/booking (created after refund implementation)

## Note on Existing Orders
Orders/bookings cancelled before the refund system implementation won't have refund data. Only new cancellations will show refund information.
